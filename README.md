This is just a small git practice session on how to start a repository
First: Go to github and click on create new repository
Second: take the SH instead of HTTP link and create a folder on your local machine
THird: Clone that repository to the desired folder
Fourth: Touch/Create some files make git status make git add "filename" git commit -m "your message" 
Fifth: finally git push
Sixth: Alternatively if i am not mistaken i could do git init on a local machine first 
and then the a github repo would be created but im not entirely sure 
still in the learning process bro
